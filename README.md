1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. No build tools or server required—everything runs statically.
3. For full functionality (contact forms, etc.), ensure your backend endpoints (e.g., `contact_process.php`) are set up if needed.

## Customization
- **Images:** Replace images in `assets/img/jtg/` and other folders with your own quarry, product, or team photos.
- **Colors & Branding:** Edit `assets/css/style.css` or the `<style>` block in `index.html` to match your brand colors.
- **Content:** Update text in the HTML files to reflect your company's unique value, team, and services.
- **Icons:** Use any [FontAwesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) icon by updating the `<i class="fas fa-..."></i>` tags.
